The overall purpose of the study was to provide land use planning support for the surrounding area of Lake Waging, located in the district of Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany.
The land use of Waging region is constantly changing. Intensive farming, housing and development of infrastructure take place at the same time and challenge the aesthetic values of the present. However, there has been still no research of the changes of land-use change in Lake waging region. Now, a multi-disciplinary approach is required.
Therefore, the study seeks to understand the risk of soil erosion in this area, assess soil erosion risk regarding agriculture and to make management strategies that consider mitigation.

In the study, the USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) was applied. USLE is a parametric model that calculates the average annual soil erosion by precipitation per unit area. It is used to measure the spatial distribution of soil loss and is derived from geographical information that includes land coverage, soil type, precipitation and topography.


**Land Use Clasification**

Six classes, including crop field, maize field, forest, grassland, urban area and water bodies, were used to determine erosion risk. First, the whole map was divided into land and water. Vegetation and non-vegetation areas were assigned based upn normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds. Forest and non-forest area were determined by the mean of shortwave infrared and brightness. Non-forest was classified as grassland and cropland according to their respective NDVI values. Since the satellite image was taken in October, harvested cropland with low vegetation was assumed to be maize fields.
