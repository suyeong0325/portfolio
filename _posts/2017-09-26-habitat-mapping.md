The main task was to classify habitat map of the transect areas in a national park. There are 4 sample transection areas defined as sample area for the research in Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald. Sampling transects were selected from low to high altitude area, therefore each transects could include environmentally, altitudinally diverse area.

Manual editing was used for the main methodology, and RGB (Red, green, blue) and CIR satellite imagery of the area were provided for the task.
The same classification hierarchy as the land use report of Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald and Å umava in 2008 by GEODIS was applied for the continuity of the map. According to the former report, there were classes of water bodies, rocks, build-up-areas, roads, natural meadows, cultivated meadows, transition zone, scrub pine, clear-cut area, dead wood(standing/lying), regeneration(coniferous/deciduous/mixed) and forest area. Then forest areas were categorized into 3 groups of coniferous, deciduous and mixed, and each category was subdivided into young (up to 6m), medium (6-20m) and mature (20m) stands.
Although water bodies, build-up-areas, roads, and meadows were easy to define, however, subcategories within forest class were difficult to define by satellite images. Thereby, field research was conducted for the better result. With Android devices with GPS, I compared classification shapefile acquired from ArcMap program and field vegetation. In result, medium-sized deciduous and young coniferous were often confused in satellite images, and mixed forest and deciduous forest were sometimes almost unable to differentiate. For those reasons, I reached the conclusion that field check is necessary for accurate classification of the forest.
And then I compared the refined vegetation map with the classification result acquired from LiDAR point clouds to see how accurate the LiDAR classification is. The result says that most of the results were identical, but LiDAR often confuses root plates of lying dead wood as regenerations of deciduous or coniferous trees.
